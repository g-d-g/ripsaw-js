        <p>ripsaw's consistent API allows developers to create extensions with new interactive geometries. All you need to do is create a constructor that inherits from RIPSAW.MasterPiece and provides the same core methods as RIPSAW.Bezier2D - the sample constructor featured in this demo.</p>
        <p>This website will soon feature a developers' tutorial demonstrating how to create a ripsaw extension that allows users to design a rectangle interactively.</p>
