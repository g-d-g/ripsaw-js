ripsaw aspires to make design within reach for people who do not think of themselves as designers. This is a joint product design and software challenge guided by the following principles:

* maximize complexity while minimizing control parameters
* provide seamless interactions
* maintain feasibility

These shelf prototypes would take a fair amount of time to design, redesign and evaluate in classical CAD programs.

ripsaw builds these complex shapes based on mere 5 control points. A slight change in the arrangement of these points produces significant changes in the geometry, which is understood and customized easily by anyone.

The mathematical concept (in this case, a city Voronoi diagram) does the hard work of generating the shape, keeping the user's focus on usability and aesthetics.
